    "last 2 Chrome version"
]
it means it will definetly run on chrome (this didn't say thaat it will not run in other broswers it just does not give gurantee , it can run or can't run)

browserlist helps in converting newer to older code with help of babel by making polyfills we can say  

who converts newer code to older code ?
it is babel which convert newer to older code

example  older browser does not know ES6 so it can make their own code 
ex - Array.map()
some browsers doesn't know map function so it make polyfill of that i.e. we can make our own function workin same as function

babel-plugin-transform-remove-console
